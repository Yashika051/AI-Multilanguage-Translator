# AI-Multilanuage-Translator

Despite being a basic component of communication, language frequently becomes a barrier when engaging with individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds. This project offers a web-based AI-powered text converter that enables users to translate text in real time between languages to address this problem. The system only requires a current browser and does not require any downloads or installations, making it easy to use, quick, and accessible.

Hugging Face's MarianMT models, a set of open-source, pre-trained machine translation models that provide excellent language translation across numerous language pairs, are used in this project. HTML and  CSS are used to create the user interface, while Flask is used to manage the backend in Python.
