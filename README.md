# AI-Multilanuage-Translator

Despite being a basic component of communication, language frequently becomes a barrier when engaging with individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds. This project offers a web-based AI-powered text converter that enables users to translate text in real time between languages to address this problem. The system only requires a current browser and does not require any downloads or installations, making it easy to use, quick, and accessible.

Hugging Face's MarianMT models, a set of open-source, pre-trained machine translation models that provide excellent language translation across numerous language pairs, are used in this project. HTML and  CSS are used to create the user interface, while Flask is used to manage the backend in Python.

This project's primary goal is to create an intuitive, AI-powered translation tool that:
•	Uses neural machine translation to translate text between languages.

•	It is simple to use and operates fully online.

•	Makes use of up-to-date, trained AI models to ensure correctness.

•	Provides an interface that is aesthetically pleasing, responsive, and tidy.

Technical Stack:

Frontend:
•	HTML – Used to create the structure of the web page, including input fields, dropdowns, and buttons.
•	CSS – Applied basic styling to elements for layout, spacing, and appearance.
Backend:
•	Python – Used as the programming language for server-side logic.
•	Flask – A lightweight web framework used to handle routing, requests, and backend processing.
•	Transformers Library (Hugging Face) – Provides MarianMT pre-trained translation models to perform accurate multilingual translation.
